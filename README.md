It works for browsers which supports Autoplay unlike Google Chrome.
Works fine for Firefox.
You will need OBS Studio for recording.
You can use Virtual speaker like Voicemeeter for separating the sound of video lectures and system sound.
For Firefox: You need to enable the autoplay option from the settings in Mozilla Firefox.
Open the webpage of the video lecture from where you want to start recording or the starting lecture of a particular module.
Open the Web console of the Firefox using ctrl+shift+k.
Just copy out the code into the console and press enter.(Depending on your internet speed, you may need to run the code twice.
Now, enable the recording of the window of Firefox from OBS Studio.
